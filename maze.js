Description: Create a text-based maze game where the player moves through a grid.

Features:
Represent the maze as a 2D array.
Allow movement (w, a, s, d for up, left, down, right).
Display the player's current position.
End the game when the player reaches the goal.
Focus: Use nested loops to render the maze and conditions to check for valid moves.
